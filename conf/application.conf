# Global object class

# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global

# Router 
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point. 
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly. 
# So for an application router like `conf/my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `my.application.routes`.

# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration

# evolutionplugin=disabled

# Ebean configuration

# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=DEBUG

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG

# custom configuration for the ec2 dashboard
# because the ec2 keys are private, we don't want to check them into github
# so we put them in a separate config file that is in the .gitignore list
